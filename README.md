In this notebook, fundamental of big data in PySpark is presented. First, it will show how to install PySpark on local machine for testing, debugging and demonstration. Then, PySpark DataFrame and PySparkSQL will be discussed. Finally, application of machine learning with PySpark MLib library will be presented with synthetic and realistic examples.
